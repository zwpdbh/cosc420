#+TITLE: COSC420 Neural Network Assignment

* Objectives
** Program
1) learn, print out the number of epochs and the current population error every 100 epochs.
2) test, enable he user to test the population of input patterns add see the activation of all units.
3) show weights

** Questions need to answer
1) How well/quickly does the network learn different kinds of tasks?
2) How do the parameter settings affect the learning process?
3) How robuts/stable is its performance in the face of noise (in the data) or damange (to the network)?
4) How well does it generalizes from a small grianning set to a larger data set from which the trainning set was a sample?
5) Find suggestions in the lectures or literature for improving generalization and explore them.
6) How much training is "enough"?
7) What is the right size for a neural network?

** Report
The report should describe:
1) the design of your network, noting the alternative designs that you considered.
   - such as, a range of different error functions
2) the results of your tests
   - the test you decide to perform
   - why these are interesting (what questions do they explore)
   - The result should be presented with discussion, what have you learned, have you answered your original questions?
3) explorations
4) Graphs and tables are very useful for summarising and presenting data.
5) An appendix which provide an overview of how to use your program.

* Program
** What functions does my program need to have?
- Be able to split the data into training set and testing set.
- During trainning print out the epoches and population error for every 100 epochs.
- After training, given an testing data, output the following:
  1) current weights
  2) current state of neurons (which including the output)
